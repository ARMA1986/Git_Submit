If Statements:

If statements basically will compare the state of a function, entry, variable.
So that if something becomes true and action will take place.

For example in class we said that the traffic light could be either green, ambar or red

If the light is green
the message "GO! it's on green" gets displayed.

If the light is red
the message "Stop!!" gets displayed.

If the light is ambar
the message "GUN IT!! you have a few seconds" gets displayed.

So the compiler needs and input
saved under the variable

public string light="green";
private string msgGreen="GO! it's on green";
private string msgRed="Stop!!";


and on the Statemente part we compare

if light == green;

print string "msgGreen";
