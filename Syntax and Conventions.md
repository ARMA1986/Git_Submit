Syntax is the grammar of a languge. The correct spelling necessary for effective comunication, in this case the way we tell the computer things it will understand.
The computers understand only "0" and "1", but computer oriented languages created to make communication
between man and machine easier has certain rules.

In the C# language for example we gotta use certain code names for certain actions

To use a interger we use the word "int" and the computer understands that we will be working with whole numbers
To use a word or series of words we use "string" and the computer knows that the input and work mode for 
the following code will be using words.
We gotta also use the a ";" to indicate the end of an action
We use brackets to tell the compiler where does a function being and end
We use "=" to tell the compiler the assignation we are giving to a variable.
And we use "==" to tell the compiler we are trying to compare equality between two items.


Conventions in the other hand has less to do with how the computer will understand what we are telling it, 
and more with having others understand what we are doing in an easier manner. It is the standard way code is
written so that others can follow one's code with ease, catch errors and understand that the coder is having proper manners when writing so to speak.

For example the computer will understand if I write my whole code within a single line but it will be harder
for others to follow along, see where something begins or ends, and it just won't look as organized.
When writing variable names, we start with a lowercase and if we want to add a second word, we use an upper case letter to indicate the beggining of the next word without leaving a space between the two.
Some coders prefer have the opening braket right after the first line of code on the same line and others prefer to have it on the next one as it shows more symmetry.
When having elements within a function or a statement, there is an indentation indicating that they are a subgroup contained in a bigger group. the brackets of those also are align according to which group they belong to.
